# Container

## Sequential container

<p>In a sequential container, the elements are stored in an order which is determined by the program. The element of the container can be accessed by the index.</p>

Example
<ol>
   <li>std::string</li>
   <li>std::vector</li>
</ol>

<p>Something worth noticed is that it can use "push_back" amd "push_front"</p>

## Associative Containers

<p>In an associative container, the elements are stored in an order which is determined by the container and depends on their value.Elements are accessed by a "key" which the container uses to look up the element</p>

Example
<ol>
   <li>std::set</li>
   <li>std::map</li>
</ol>

Some methods that can be used:

<ol>
   <li>insert() and erase()</li>
   <li>begin() and end()</li>
   <li>Algorithm-like member functions such as find() and sort()</li>
</ol>
